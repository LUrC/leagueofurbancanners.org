<p>The Promotional flyer  provides information about LUrC for potential members and owners of fruit trees. It is ideal for leaving at houses where you see delicious fruit that looks like it needs to be harvested. In addition to the single page flyer, you can download a version that contains four mini flyers per page here.</p>

<p>The Harvesting waiver can be given to home-owners at their request. It waives all liability they might face should a member of LUrC be injured on their property.</p>

<p>The Canning labels can be used to label jars of LUrC preserves.  Identifying LUrC jars makes them easier to retrieve after being distributed to owners and friends. </p>
