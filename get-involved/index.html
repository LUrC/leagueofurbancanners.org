<h1>Get Involved</h1>

<p>There are opportunities to get involved in all phases of the organizationâ€™s activities as a member of LUrC. There is no fee to join. In exchange for work, members share the products of the harvest. The best way to keep abreast of harvests and other activities is to sign up for our <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/leagueofurbancanners/subscribe">Google Group listserv</a>.</p>

<!--<h2>Pruning</h2>

<p>Our pruning season starts in February, when the trees are dormant, and goes through April as the buds start to break. The purpose of pruning is to maintain the health of the trees in our orchard and improve fruit production. All pruning sessions are lead by experienced pruners and horticulturists and are open to all members regardless of experience.</p>

<p>In addition to pruning, we are testing options for controlling pests and improving the health of the soil around fruit trees.</p>-->

<h2>Harvesting</h2>

<p>Our harvesting season starts in June with the first mulberries and goes into October with the last of the quince. Each year, we harvest an average of 5,000 pounds of fruit, including cherries, apricots, plums, peaches, pears, and apples with each harvest averaging 70 pounds. Harvests teams are usually made up of a lead harvester and 1-4 other members. Harvest members receive 20 percent of the final product of the harvest. <!--The following are examples of three urban harvesting methods and below is a time line of our harvest season.</p>

<h3>Hand Pick</h3>

<p>Hand picking as the name implies means picking each fruit or bunch of fruit one at at time. Small fruit such as grapes, cornelian cherries and june berries are always hand picked. Cherries are a special case and need to be cut from the tree so as not to damage the stem. Generally hand picking requires a ladder which limits the number of possible participants.</p>

<h3>Tarp and Shake</h3>

<p>The tarp and shake method involves four people each holding a corner of a tarp under the fruit tree while a fifth person shakes the branches vigorously with a pole to make it rain fruit. Mulberries and crabapples are always harvested using this method. This method also works well for larger fruit that are clustered in tall trees. When harvesting larger fruit, we recommend harvesters wear helmets as the fruit can come down fast.</p>

<h3>Pole Pick</h3>

<p>In this method, a long pole with a basket and hook on one end is used reach high up in the tree and grab one or more fruit at a time. This sort of picking can be accomplished by one person. It generally works well for larger fruit on less densely fruited trees.</p>-->

<h2>Preserving</h2>

<p>During the harvest season, we try to preserve all of our harvest through canning, pickling, drying, and fermenting. After each harvest, the members of the harvest team may decide to preserve the fruit themselves or farm out the task to members with experience making preserves. Preservers keep 70% of what they make and harvesters receive 20%. We return 10% to the owners to thank them for their fruit!</p>

<p>Members who do not have experience making preserves can offer to help canners sort, wash, pit, peel, and chop fruit from large harvests to prepare it for preserving. This is a great way to get introduced to the process of making preserves.</p>

<p>In addition, we have hosted an annual group apple cidering event at which we process an average of 800 pounds of apples in a single day, making many gallons of both hard and soft cider.</p>

<h2>Organizational</h2>

<p>The following are five additional ways to get involved with LUrC beyond harvesting and preserving. All of these tasks are very important to ensuring that LUrC is successful each year. Please contact us if you are interested in helping in any of these areas.</p>

<h3>Ladder Ferry</h3>

<p>Ladder Ferries haul our 8-foot trailer loaded with tools and/or fruit to harvest sites and fruit drops. Harvest leaders can request a ladder ferry for their harvest in exchange for a percentage of the harvest preserves.</p>

<h3>Site Coordinator</h3>

<p>Site coordinators are responsible for overseeing one or more fruit trees in the LUrC database. Each year, they contact the owner to confirm that the site is available for harvesting, and then check the fruit during harvest season to determine when it is ready to harvest. Once they determine the fruit is ready for harvest, they contact the owner to schedule a harvest.</p>

<!--<h3>Fruit Drops</h3>

<p>Fruit drops are designated secure locations outside of homes or apartments where harvesters can leave extra or all the fruit from their harvest. These sites are managed by an experienced canner who is willing to process extra fruit. In addition, these sites serve as redistribution points where other members can pick up fruit for processing. Each fruit drop is responsible for specifying on the website when they are available.</p>-->

<h3>Tree Scouts</h3>

<p>Tree scouts bike or walk around the city finding new fruit trees for our database. When they find a new fruit tree, they are asked to email urbanapplesauce (at) gmail (dot) com, and leave a flyer at the site. If they are comfortable talking to strangers, they should knock on the door and let the owner know about LUrC. There are still trees to be discovered!</p>

<h3>Other</h3>

<p>LUrC is always looking for help with software development, database design, website development and design, and building tools and trailers.</p>
