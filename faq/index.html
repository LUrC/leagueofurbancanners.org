<h1>FAQ</h1>

<dl>
  <dt>Can I participate if I don’t have any experience?</dt>
  <dd>Definitely! Most of our members join without ever having pruned trees, harvested fruit, or made preserves. New members learn these skills working alongside experienced members. In addition, we offer dedicated pruning training sessions each winter.</dd>

  <dt>Isn’t fruit from the city bad to eat?</dt>
  <dd>Much of the fruit grown in the city is grown in
  soil that contains lead. It is our understanding that lead does not accumulate in the fruit. For more information check out <a href="http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/yard-garden/soils/lead-in-home-garden/">http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/yard-garden/soils/lead-in-home-garden/</a></dd>

  <dt>Does LUrC sell fruit?</dt>
  <dd>No. None of our fruit is processed in a certified kitchen, so it is unavailable for sale.</dd>

  <dt>Does LUrC donate fruit?</dt>
  <dd>Some. LUrC is a completely non-financial self-sustaining operation open to everyone with members from a wide range of social and economic backgrounds. On request, members of LUrC have donated harvested fruit to local food programs each year.  </dd>

  <dt>Is LUrC a non-profit?</dt>
  <dd>No. LUrC’s organizational model works with
  essentially no budget, so unlike a non-profit, it
  does not require money from the community for overhead and operating expenses.</dd>

  <dt>How much fruit will I keep?</dt>
  <dd>We suggest that final product from a harvest is divided with 10 percent going to owners, 20 percent going to harvesters, and 70 percent going to canners. Canning is a lot of work and requires the most resources. These numbers are recommendations and can vary depending on the work involved.</dd>

  <dt>How do I find out about harvests?</dt>
  <dd>Harvests are posted weekly on the listserv during harvest season. To join a harvest simply respond to the postings. To join the listserv click here.</dd>

  <dt>Can I just harvest fruit and not preserve it?</dt>
  <dd>Sure! Harvesters are only responsible for harvesting. Harvest leaders are responsible for making sure the fruit gets processed. All harvesters receive 20 percent of the total processed fruit.</dd>

  <dt>Can I just preserve fruit and not harvest it?</dt>
  <dd>Sure! Before and after harvests, harvest leaders post to the listserv to find members interested in preserving fruit. Members who preserve fruit keep seventy percent of what they make and return thirty percent to the harvest leader. Fruit is generally preserved in members own kitchens.</dd>

  <dt>What if I don’t live in Somerville or Cambridge?</dt>
  <dd>While the focus of our operation is mostly on Cambridge and Somerville, we welcome members from other cities and will harvest trees within biking distance. One of goals though is to stay small, so if you do live in another city and are interested, please consider starting your own harvesting operation.</dd>
