<h1>Fruit Tree Owners</h1>

<p>The League of Urban Canners (LUrC) offers pruning and harvesting services for fruit trees and arbors primarily in the Cambridge and Somerville area. All of the fruit we harvest is processed into preserves such as jams, jellies and dried fruit. Ten percent of the preserves we make from a tree or arbor is returned to the owner.</p>

<h2>Pruning</h2>

<p>Pruning services are available starting in late winter and ending in early spring. Our pruning techniques are designed to maintain the health of the tree and improve the production of fruit. We offer pruning services free of charge. In exchange for pruning a fruit tree or arbor, we ask for the right to harvest.</p>

<h2>Harvesting</h2>

<p>Harvesting starts in the spring and ends in late fall. In exchange for allowing us to harvesting, we return ten percent of the preserves made from a harvest to the owners. The following is a list of fruit that we harvest.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mulberries (red)</li>
  <li>June berries</li>
