<h1>About</h1>

<p>The League of Urban Canners (LUrC) was founded by Sam Christy in the late fall of 2011 when he and some friends from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140529225851/http://somervilleyogurtmakingcoop.wordpress.com/member-area/survey/">Somerville Yogurt Making Coop</a> harvested and canned a couple hundred pounds of unwanted apples and grapes growing in yards and over driveways in Somerville and Cambridge, both small urban cities just outside of Boston. By the end of following year, armed only with a simple flyer offering owners a percentage of preserves in exchange for their fruit, they had harvested and canned over 4000 pounds of a dozen different kinds of fruit.</p>

<p>In just two years, LUrC has built  a database of over 300 fruit trees and arbors and has agreements with owners to harvest just under 100 of these. Along with harvesting, LUrC now prunes the trees and arbors they harvest in order to improve fruit production, and acts as stewards over their urban orchard which is made up of trees scattered throughout the city. In addition, as serious bike advocates, the group completes almost all of their work using pedal (and foot) power and a really long bike trailer!</p>

<p>In 2013, second full season of harvesting, more than a hundred members participated in harvesting and processing over 5000 pounds of fruit.</p>

<h2>Staff</h2>

<p>LUrC is organized around a “micro-overhead” model and as a result, does not have any full or part-time staff. Members of the group share in organizational tasks as needed and most of the decisions are made by consensus. This year, the group has been hosting monthly organizational meetings outside of harvest season. Everyone is invited to attend.</p>

<h2>Mission</h2>

<p>LUrC is an alternative economic model for food production where members of the community work together to produce food for themselves. Many people are faced with a dilemma: corporations produce goods efficiently through the economies of scale, but they tend to place profit over access to quality food and sustainable environmental practices. On the other hand, the independence represented by the DIY food movement is inaccessible to many people who lack the skills and time needed to “DIY” all their basic needs.</p>

<p>The LUrC model offers the best of both worlds: working together, members of LUrC share  resources and skills, achieve an economy of scale, and create a sustainable community of people who have learned to rely on each other and care for each other. With this model in mind, LUrC’s goal is to provide an alternative model for sustainable food production that works for everyone.</p>
